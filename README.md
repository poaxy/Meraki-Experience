A browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (WebExtensions API) that dynamically enhances the experience for Meraki-related pages. The extension provides intelligent tab management, enhanced documentation features, universal text replacement capabilities, and **Omni-Channel Quick Tools** for Salesforce Lightning pages.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This extension relies heavily on the design and structure of the target websites it operates on. If the structure of these websites changes significantly, the extension code will need to be updated accordingly to maintain functionality.**

### What This Means
- The extension uses DOM selectors and page structure to identify and enhance specific elements
- Website redesigns, layout changes, or structural modifications may break extension features
- Regular maintenance and updates may be required to keep the extension working properly
- Users should report issues when features stop working after website updates
